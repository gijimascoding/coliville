# Moving to Montreal in 2026: The Honest Guide for Young People

So you are moving to Montreal. Maybe you got into McGill or Concordia. Maybe you landed an internship downtown. Maybe you just want to live somewhere that does not charge you $2,400 for a basement apartment (looking at you, Toronto). Whatever your reason, this city is about to become your favorite place on Earth -- if you know how to set yourself up right.

This guide covers everything you actually need to know before relocating to Montreal: where to live, what it costs, how to get around, and how to skip the most common mistakes new arrivals make.

**Ready to skip the housing headache entirely?** [Apply now at Coliville](https://coliville.com/apply) -- furnished private rooms starting at $800/month, utilities included.

## What Montreal Actually Costs in 2026

Let's get the numbers out of the way. The cost of living in Montreal in 2026 is real, but it is still one of the most affordable major cities in Canada.

### Rent

Here is the honest breakdown:

- **One-bedroom apartment (unfurnished):** Around $1,566/month
- **Two-bedroom apartment:** Roughly $1,930/month
- **Studio downtown:** $1,300-$1,600/month
- **Co-living private room (Coliville):** starting at $800/month, furnished, utilities included

That one-bedroom number does not include wifi, electricity, furniture, or the hundreds of dollars you will spend at IKEA pretending you know how to assemble a KALLAX shelf. When you add those hidden costs, a "cheap" studio can easily run you over $2,000/month.

### Monthly Budget Snapshot

A realistic monthly budget for a young person in Montreal looks like this:

- **Rent:** $800-$1,600 (depending on your housing choice)
- **Groceries:** $350-$450
- **Transit pass (STM):** $104.50 (or $62.75 with a student reduced fare)
- **Phone plan:** $40-$60
- **Going out, coffee, fun:** $200-$400

Living solo, you are looking at roughly $3,100/month to be comfortable. But you can bring that number way down with the right housing setup.

## Best Neighborhoods in Montreal for Young People

Not all neighborhoods are created equal. Here is where young professionals and students actually want to live -- and why.

### The Plateau (Plateau-Mont-Royal)

The classic. Colorful row houses, independent coffee shops on every corner, and more street art than most cities have in their entire downtown. The Plateau is walkable, bikeable, and close to everything. Rent is higher here, but the lifestyle makes it worth considering. Great for creatives, freelancers, and anyone who wants to feel like they are in a movie.

### Mile End

Right next to the Plateau but with its own personality. Mile End is the bagel capital of Montreal (St-Viateur vs. Fairmount -- pick a side). It is packed with indie music venues, vintage shops, and tech startups. If you work in a creative field, this is your neighborhood.

### Griffintown

The new kid. Griffintown went from old industrial zone to condo towers and trendy restaurants in about a decade. It is modern, close to downtown, and popular with young professionals who want a newer build. The ETS university campus is right there, and the Lachine Canal is perfect for runs and bike rides.

### Verdun

Verdun is the neighborhood everyone is talking about in 2026. It is more affordable than the Plateau, sits right on the St. Lawrence River, and has a growing food scene. The green metro line connects you to downtown in about 15 minutes. If you want space without feeling disconnected, Verdun is it.

### NDG (Notre-Dame-de-Grace)

Close to Concordia's Loyola campus, NDG is a residential neighborhood with a strong community feel. Rent is more reasonable here, and Monkland Avenue has solid restaurants and cafes. It is quieter than downtown, which is either a pro or a con depending on what you are after.

### Rosemont and Hochelaga

These are the value picks. Rosemont is family-friendly but increasingly popular with young renters who got priced out of the Plateau. Hochelaga is grittier but has some of the lowest rents on the island, and it is changing fast. Both are well-connected by metro.

## Getting Around: Transit, Bikes, and Winter

### The STM (Metro and Bus)

Montreal's metro system is clean, reliable, and runs four lines across the city. A monthly pass costs $104.50 (or $62.75 for students). The new REM light rail also connects the airport and South Shore suburbs. You do not need a car here -- seriously.

### BIXI Bikes

From April to November, BIXI bike-sharing is everywhere. An annual membership costs around $100, and it is the fastest way to get across the Plateau, Mile End, or Griffintown during warm months.

### Winter Reality Check

Yes, winter is real. It gets to -25C. You will need a proper winter coat, waterproof boots, and layers. But the city does not shut down. The metro runs underground, there is an entire underground city (RESO) downtown, and Montrealers treat winter like a sport. You adapt faster than you think.

## The Bilingual Thing: Do You Need French?

Montreal is officially francophone. Street signs, government services, and many workplaces operate in French. Here is the honest take:

- **For daily life:** You can get by in English, especially downtown, in the West Island, and in NDG. But learning basic French makes everything easier and people genuinely appreciate the effort.
- **For work:** Many jobs require at least functional French, especially in government, healthcare, and customer-facing roles. Tech and some corporate jobs operate in English.
- **For school:** McGill and Concordia are English universities. UQAM and UdeM are French.

Download Duolingo, take a free French course at a local community center, and start with "bonjour" instead of "hi" at every shop. That one word changes how people treat you.

## Montreal Housing Tips: How to Avoid Getting Burned

### Know the July 1 Rule

July 1 is national moving day in Quebec. Most leases start and end on July 1, which means the entire city is moving at once. If you are relocating to Montreal for September (back-to-school), start looking in May or June. Waiting until August means slim pickings and inflated prices.

### Watch for Hidden Costs

An apartment listed at $1,200/month might not include electricity (Hydro-Quebec), internet, hot water, or appliances. Always ask what is included before signing. Some places do not even come with a fridge.

### Consider Co-Living

If you are new to the city, do not know anyone, and do not want to furnish an entire apartment from scratch, co-living is the move. You get a private room, shared common spaces, included utilities and wifi, and roommates who are actually vetted and matched. No Kijiji horror stories.

## FAQ

### How much money do I need to move to Montreal?

Plan for first and last month's rent (or just first month with co-living), plus about $2,000-$3,000 for initial setup costs like a winter coat, transit pass, groceries, and a phone plan. With co-living at Coliville, you skip furniture and utility deposits entirely, which can save you $1,500 or more upfront.

### Is Montreal a good city for young professionals?

Yes. Montreal has a strong job market in tech, gaming, AI, aerospace, and the creative industries. The cost of living is significantly lower than Toronto or Vancouver, the food scene is world-class, and the city has a culture that actually values quality of life. It consistently ranks among the best cities in North America for people under 35.

### Do I need to speak French to live in Montreal?

You do not need fluent French to survive, but learning some is a major advantage. Many workplaces require at least basic French proficiency, and it opens up more housing options, social circles, and job opportunities. Start learning before you arrive.

### What is the best neighborhood in Montreal for students?

It depends on your university. For McGill, look at the Plateau, Mile End, or the Ghetto (Milton-Parc area near campus). For Concordia, NDG or downtown. For UQAM, the Quartier Latin or Rosemont. For UdeM, Cote-des-Neiges. Co-living with Coliville places you in neighborhoods with easy access to all major campuses.

### When should I start looking for housing in Montreal?

Start at least two to three months before your move-in date. If you are moving for September, begin your search in June. If you are moving July 1, start in April. The earlier you lock in a room, the better your options and pricing.
