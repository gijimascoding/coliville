# Co-Living vs Apartment in Montreal: The Honest Comparison

You are looking at apartments in Montreal and the numbers are making your head spin. Studios listed at $1,500. One-bedrooms pushing $1,700. Then you add furniture, wifi, hydro, and renters insurance -- and suddenly your "affordable" place costs over $2,000 a month.

There is another option that most people overlook: co-living. And once you see how co-living vs apartment in Montreal actually compares, the choice becomes pretty clear.

## What Is Co-Living, Exactly?

Co-living means you get your own private room inside a shared home. You have your own space, your own lock, your own setup -- but you share common areas like the kitchen, living room, and sometimes a workspace with a small group of housemates.

Think of it as the best parts of having roommates without the worst parts. No hunting for someone on Kijiji who "seems normal." No splitting hydro bills over passive-aggressive group chats. No furnishing an empty apartment from scratch.

At [Coliville](https://coliville.com/locations), co-living in Montreal starts at $800/month. That includes a furnished private room, utilities, wifi, and roommate matching -- all in neighborhoods like the Plateau, Mile End, Griffintown, and Verdun.

## The Real Cost Breakdown: Co-Living vs Studio Apartment in Montreal

This is where the studio apartment Montreal cost conversation gets uncomfortable. Here is what renting a studio in Montreal actually looks like in 2026, compared to co-living.

### Monthly Cost Comparison Table

| Expense | Studio Apartment | Co-Living (Coliville) |
|---|---|---|
| Base rent | $1,500 - $1,700 | starting at $800 |
| Furniture (amortized) | $100 - $200 | $0 (included) |
| Electricity / Hydro | $60 - $120 | $0 (included) |
| Internet / Wifi | $50 - $80 | $0 (included) |
| Renters insurance | $25 - $40 | $0 (included) |
| Laundry / supplies | $20 - $30 | $0 (included) |
| **Total monthly cost** | **$1,755 - $2,170** | **starting at $800** |

That is not a typo. When you compare co-living vs apartment in Montreal on a true-cost basis, you could save $700 to $1,000 every single month. Over a 12-month lease, that is $8,400 to $12,000 back in your pocket. That is a trip home for the holidays, a summer in Europe, or a serious dent in your student loans.

## Shared Housing vs Apartment Montreal: Beyond the Money

Cost is the headline, but it is not the whole story. Here is how shared housing vs apartment in Montreal stacks up on everything else that matters when you are 18 to 35.

### Flexibility and Lease Terms

Traditional Montreal apartments typically lock you into a 12-month lease starting July 1. If your internship ends in December or you are only in town for one semester, tough luck -- you are either subletting (stressful) or paying for months you do not use.

Co-living offers flexible terms. At Coliville, you can find options that work around your actual schedule, not an arbitrary calendar. Moving to Montreal for a 4-month stage? Starting a contract in September? You are covered.

### Furnishing: Move In With a Suitcase

Finding affordable housing in Montreal is hard enough. Furnishing an empty studio from zero? That is a second headache on top of the first one. A bed, desk, chair, kitchenware, and basic furniture easily runs $2,000 to $4,000 upfront, even if you are buying from Facebook Marketplace and IKEA.

Furnished rooms in Montreal through co-living spaces come ready to go. Bed, desk, storage, kitchen essentials -- it is all there. You show up with your suitcase and your laptop, and you are home.

### Social Life: Roommate vs Living Alone Montreal

Here is the part nobody talks about enough. Moving to a new city alone is exciting for about two weeks. Then it gets quiet. Really quiet.

Living alone in a studio means your social life depends entirely on your own effort -- joining clubs, finding events, forcing yourself out when you would rather not. For students at McGill, Concordia, UQAM, or UdeM, campus helps. But once classes end for the day, you are back in a 300-square-foot box by yourself.

The roommate vs living alone Montreal debate has a clear answer for most young people: having good housemates makes your life better. The key word is "good." Random Kijiji roommates are a gamble. Co-living spaces like Coliville use roommate matching to pair you with people based on lifestyle, schedule, cleanliness habits, and personality. You are not rolling the dice. You are getting housemates you actually want to come home to.

### Utilities and Hidden Costs

Studio renters in Montreal deal with a pile of small bills that add up fast. Hydro-Quebec bills that spike in winter. Internet contracts with cancellation fees. Laundry coins. Household supplies. Lightbulbs. A plunger you hope you never need.

Co-living bundles all of that into one monthly price. No surprises, no hidden fees, no December hydro bill that makes you question every space heater decision you have ever made.

## Who Should Choose Co-Living vs an Apartment in Montreal?

Co-living is not for everyone. If you are settled in Montreal with a full-time salary, a partner, and a cat, a one-bedroom apartment makes sense for you.

But if you check any of these boxes, co-living is probably the smarter move:

- You are a student at McGill, Concordia, UQAM, or UdeM
- You are moving to Montreal for an internship or contract
- You are a young professional in your first or second job
- You want to save money without living in a basement apartment in Laval
- You want to meet people without relying on dating apps and meetup groups
- You need a furnished room because you are coming from another city or country
- You want flexibility -- not a rigid 12-month lease

If three or more of those apply, stop apartment hunting and look at co-living instead.
