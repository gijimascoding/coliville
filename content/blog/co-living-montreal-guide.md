# Co-Living Montreal: The Complete Guide for Students and Young Professionals

Montreal rents jumped 7.2% in 2025. Average one-bedroom apartments downtown now hover around $1,668 per month -- and that is before you factor in furniture, utilities, internet, and the soul-crushing experience of apartment hunting on Kijiji. If you are a student at McGill, Concordia, UQAM, or UdeM, or a young professional just getting started in the city, that math does not work.

Co-living in Montreal is the alternative that actually makes sense. You get a private, furnished room with utilities included, flexible lease terms, and a built-in community of people your age -- all starting from $680 per month. No surprise hydro bills. No IKEA trips. No awkward Craigslist roommate lottery.

## What Is Co-Living, Exactly?

Co-living is a modern shared housing model where you rent your own private room inside a fully furnished home or apartment. You share common spaces like the kitchen, living room, and sometimes a coworking area with your housemates. But your bedroom is yours -- locked door, your space, your rules.

Here is what separates co-living from a traditional roommate situation:

- **Furnished rooms**: Bed, desk, storage -- everything is already there when you move in.
- **All-inclusive pricing**: Rent covers utilities, WiFi, and often cleaning of shared areas. One bill. That is it.
- **Flexible leases**: No 12-month commitment required. Month-to-month options exist for interns, exchange students, and anyone who is not ready to lock in.
- **Roommate matching**: You do not have to find your own roommates. The co-living provider matches you with compatible housemates based on lifestyle, schedule, and preferences.
- **Community**: Events, shared meals, group chats -- co-living spaces are designed for people who want to actually know the people they live with.

Think of it as the best parts of dorm life combined with the privacy and independence of your own apartment.

## Why Co-Living Works in Montreal

Montreal is one of the best cities in North America for young people. The culture, the food scene, the festivals, the bilingual energy -- there is a reason people move here from across Canada and around the world. But the housing market has not kept up.

### The Rent Problem Is Real

The vacancy rate in Montreal sits at just 2.2% in 2026. Studios and one-bedrooms that were affordable five years ago have been swallowed by rising demand from students, new grads, and international workers. If you want to live alone in the Plateau or Griffintown, expect to pay $1,500 or more per month -- not including furniture or utilities.

Co-living cuts through that. At [Coliville](https://coliville.com), private rooms start at $680 per month with everything included. That is real savings you can put toward tuition, student loans, or just actually enjoying the city you moved to.

### You Just Got Here and Need a Place Fast

Maybe you landed an internship downtown. Maybe you got accepted to Concordia for the winter semester. Maybe you are moving from Toronto or Paris and do not have a local network to help you find housing. Co-living solves the cold-start problem. You apply online, get matched with a room and housemates, and move in with a suitcase. Furnished rooms in Montreal through co-living providers mean you skip the weeks of furniture shopping, lease negotiations, and utility setup.

### You Actually Want to Meet People

This is the part that surprises most people. Shared housing in Montreal through a co-living model is not just about saving money. It is about building a social circle in a new city without relying on awkward networking events or hoping your coworkers want to hang out on weekends. Your housemates become your default friend group -- the people you grab coffee with on Saint-Laurent, split a poutine with after a late study session, or explore Jean-Talon Market with on a Saturday morning.

## Best Montreal Neighborhoods for Co-Living

Not every neighborhood hits the same. Here is where co-living makes the most sense in Montreal, depending on your situation.

### Plateau Mont-Royal

The Plateau is the quintessential Montreal experience. Tree-lined streets, indie coffee shops on every corner, and a 15-minute bike ride to McGill or UQAM. It is walkable, vibrant, and packed with people in their 20s. Co-living spaces here tend to fill up fast, especially before September.

### Mile End

Creative, laid-back, and slightly more affordable than the Plateau. Mile End is home to studios, tech startups, and some of the best bagels in the country. If you are a freelancer, remote worker, or arts student, this is your neighborhood.

### Griffintown

Modern condos, proximity to ETS and Concordia's downtown campus, and easy access to the Lachine Canal for runs and bike rides. Griffintown attracts young professionals who want a newer build without moving to the suburbs. Coliving spaces in this area often come with building amenities like gyms and rooftop terraces.

### NDG (Notre-Dame-de-Grace)

More residential, more spacious, more affordable. NDG is popular with Concordia Loyola campus students and anyone who prefers a quieter pace without leaving the island. The 105 bus connects you to downtown in about 25 minutes.

### Verdun

Verdun has transformed over the past few years into one of Montreal's most popular neighborhoods for young renters. It sits right along the river, has a growing restaurant scene, and remains one of the more affordable options on the island. Affordable housing for young professionals in Montreal often starts here.

## How Much Does Co-Living in Montreal Cost?

Here is a realistic cost comparison for a young professional or student in Montreal:

| Expense | Traditional Rental | Co-Living at Coliville |
|---|---|---|
| Rent (private room) | $1,200-$1,668/mo | $680-$1,100/mo |
| Furniture (amortized) | $100-$200/mo | Included |
| Utilities (hydro, heat) | $80-$150/mo | Included |
| Internet | $60-$80/mo | Included |
| Renter's insurance | $30-$50/mo | $30-$50/mo |
| **Total** | **$1,470-$2,148/mo** | **$710-$1,150/mo** |

That is a potential savings of $500 to $1,000 per month. Over a 12-month lease, you are looking at $6,000 to $12,000 back in your pocket. For a student or intern, that is a game-changer.

## How Roommate Matching Works

One of the biggest concerns about shared housing is ending up with terrible roommates. Co-living providers like Coliville handle roommate matching for you. During the application process, you answer questions about your lifestyle -- sleep schedule, cleanliness standards, noise tolerance, social preferences. The matching algorithm pairs you with housemates who actually fit your living style.

No more gambling on a stranger from Facebook Marketplace. No more passive-aggressive notes about dishes. Roommate matching in Montreal through a co-living provider is the difference between dreading your living situation and genuinely looking forward to coming home.

## FAQ

### How is co-living different from renting a room on Kijiji?

Co-living provides a structured, all-inclusive living experience. Your room comes furnished, utilities and WiFi are included in the rent, and your housemates are matched based on compatibility. A Kijiji room rental is a private transaction with no guarantees about furnishings, included costs, or who you will be living with.

### Can I do a short-term stay or month-to-month lease?

Yes. Co-living in Montreal is built for flexibility. Whether you need a room for a four-month internship, a single semester, or an open-ended stay, flexible lease terms are a core part of the model. At Coliville, you are not locked into a 12-month lease.

### Is co-living only for students?

Not at all. Co-living attracts students, interns, young professionals, remote workers, and anyone relocating to Montreal who wants a hassle-free, community-oriented living setup. If you are between 18 and 35 and want a furnished room without the traditional rental headaches, co-living is built for you.

### What is included in the monthly rent?

At Coliville, your rent covers your private furnished room, all utilities (hydro, heating), high-speed WiFi, access to shared common areas, and regular cleaning of shared spaces. One monthly payment. No hidden fees.

### How do I apply for a co-living room in Montreal?

The process is simple. Visit [coliville.com/apply](https://coliville.com/apply), fill out a short application with your move-in date, budget, and neighborhood preferences, and the team will match you with available rooms. Most applicants hear back within 48 hours.
